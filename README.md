# Top 20 Crypto Project
This React app allows users to stay up-to-date on the top 20 ranked cryptocurrencies by using the CoinGecko API to retrieve real-time information. The app features a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to easily view details on individual cryptocurrencies, such as price, market capitalization, and 24-hour volume. The project was developed with a focus on functionality and user experience.

# What did I learn?

-I learned about hooks such as useState and useEffect while using Axios to interact with an API. 

-Learned about React Router Dom and how to create dynamic routes in a react application

-Learn about useParams, DOMpurify, and navigating common issues when working with API's in React.

# In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
