# Top 20 Crypto Project
This React application facilitates the acquisition of real-time information pertaining to the top 20 ranked cryptocurrencies, leveraging the CoinGecko API as the primary data source. The application boasts a sleek and intuitive interface, enabling users to easily access and peruse details on individual cryptocurrencies, such as current pricing, market capitalization, and 24-hour trading volume. The development of this project was approached with a keen emphasis on both functionality and user experience, ensuring that the end-user is provided with an optimal digital experience.

# What did I learn?

Through this experience, I have developed a deep understanding of various React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, and have effectively employed them in conjunction with the Axios library to facilitate seamless API interactions. Furthermore, I have honed my skills in utilizing React Router Dom to construct dynamic routes within a React-based application. Additionally, I have gained expertise in the utilization of useParams, DOMpurify and have acquired a keen understanding of the various challenges that may arise when working with APIs in a React environment and the strategies for addressing them

# In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
